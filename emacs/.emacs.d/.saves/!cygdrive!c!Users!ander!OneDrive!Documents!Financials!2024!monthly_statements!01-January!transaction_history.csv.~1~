          (https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)
        Contact us as soon as you can if you think your statement or
        receipt is wrong or if you need more information about
        a transfer on the statement or receipt. We must hear from
        you no later than 60 days after we sent you the FIRST
        statement on which the error or problem appeared.
        1. Tell us your name and username or phone number.
        2. Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about,
           and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is

        3. Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.
        We will investigate your complaint and will correct any
        error promptly. If we take more than 10 business days to do
        this, we will credit your account for the amount you think
        is in error, so that you will have the use of the money
        during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.
