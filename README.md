# config
A repo for tracking my various configuration files across programs


## Contents
---
### bash
This contains the **.bashrc** and **.bashrc_user** files

On my Windows systems, I place the **.bashrc_user** file at

```
~/OneDrive/.bashrc_user
```

On my Linux systems, both of the two files live at my home directory

```
~/.bashrc
~/.bashrc_user
```

### emacs
This contains

```
.emacs
.emacs.d/
```

Both of these files should be palced at the home directory.
